-------------------------------------

Jester mode
-There is crewmates, an imposter and a jester. The crewmates and imposter have their obvious tasks, but the jester has a special one. They must try to get voted out as best they can. They want people to think they are the imposter. If crewmates vote them out, the crewmates lose.
Procedurally generated levels
-Randomly select rooms, randomly select a possition to put them in, use some sort of pathfinding to create hallways based on the room locations.
